Hssqlppp
========

A parser, pretty printer, and type checker for SQL written in
Haskell. Supports PostgreSQL SQL and PL/pgSQL syntax. BSD licensed.

Status
======

Pre-alpha. Support for parsing SQL is patchy, but not too bad. Support
for typechecking is also patchy. See these extracts from the test
files for examples of the kind of fragments which parse:
...

Is currently able to successfully parse and partially type check three
moderately sized SQL files from another project.

Parameterised statements: can be used to read a catalog either from a
database or from the SQL DDL source code, and provide enough type
information for parameterised crud statements to produce type-safe
wrappers for many common crud statements (the main thing missing is
nullability inference, so all the types are Maybes).

Installation
============

Use

    cabal update

then

    cabal install hssqlppp

to install.

It's currently developed on GHC 6.12, but the latest release still
worked on 6.10.

Development info
================

Get latest development version:

    bzr branch lp:~jakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk

(This version is often a mess and sometimes broken).

Uses Parsec for parsing, HDBC for database access, and UUAGC to assist
the type checking. Comes with a small test suite.
