Modifying the code:

To work with the code, you can use cabal to build, but this won't work
if you need to change the ast types. In this case, you need to install
uuagc-0.9.15 (some of the other versions don't work but this one
definitely does).

Make your changes to the .ag files
(src/Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/AstInternal.ag is the main one),
then generate AstInternal.hs using the instructions at the top of
AstInternal.ag. You then need to run another hacky utility. See
devel/MakeAntiNodes.lhs for instructions. You can then use cabal again
to build with the update ast node types.
