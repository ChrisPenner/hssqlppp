HsSqlPpp
========

A parser, pretty printer, and type checker for SQL written in
Haskell. Supports PostgreSQL SQL and PL/pgSQL syntax. BSD licensed.

Status
======

Pre-alpha. Support for parsing SQL is patchy, but not too bad. Support
for type-checking is also patchy. See these extracts from the test
files for examples of the kind of SQL which parses and type checks:

* [Parsing examples](ParserTests.html)
* [Type-checking examples](TypeCheckTests.html)

Is currently able to successfully parse and partially type check three
moderately sized SQL files from another project.

Installation
============

Use

    cabal update
    cabal install hssqlppp

to install.

It's currently developed on GHC 6.12, but the latest release still
works on 6.10.

Documentation
=============

[Browse the Haddock documentation](haddock/index.html)

[See some usage examples](examples.html)

The source code has lots of comments, browse online:

* [Haddock/HsColour source](haddock/src/)
* [pandoc/ highlighting-kate](pandoc_source/index.html)
* [Launchpad](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Ejakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk/files)

Development info
================

Get latest development version:

    bzr branch lp:~jakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk

(This version is often a mess and sometimes broken).

Uses Parsec for parsing, HDBC for database access, and UUAGC to assist
the type checking (UUAGC is not needed to build from source unless you
edit the .ag files). Comes with a small test suite.
