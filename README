A very rough parser and pretty printer for postgresql sql and plpgsql

Partially supports:
basic select statements, from, where, order by, limit
  joins
  except, union
  simple window functions
  some case expressions
plpgsql select into, but not sql select into
create table plus simple check constraints, no keys
create view
insert, multirows and select flavours
basic update and delete
create function for sql and plpgsql functions
simple create domain
plpgsql statements, etc:
        assignment
        return
        raise
        null
        perform
        forif

Many things are missing at the moment, in particular
  parsing sql whilst rejecting plpgsql constructs
  group by, having, cte, window keyword, intersect
  joins in updates
  most constraints
  alter and drop statements
  transaction commands
  triggers and trigger functions
  execute
  returning
  loop
  case statement
  while
  for, integer variant
  error trapping
  cursors
This is a non-exhaustive list

The parse tree node types aren't well designed - this is bad if you
want to use this code to parse or generate sql in another project right
now.

No thought has been put into error messages.
No work has been done on correctly rejecting invalid sql.
No thought has been given in respects to supporting other sql dialects.

(There is no ideological reason why none of these things have been done.)
