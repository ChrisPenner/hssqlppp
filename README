A very rough parser and pretty printer for postgresql sql and plpgsql

Partially supports:
basic select statements, from, where, order by, limit
  joins
  except, union, intersect
  simple window functions
  some case expressions
plpgsql select into, but not sql select into
create table
constraints: not null, null, unique
create view
insert, multirows and select flavours
update and delete, including returning
create function for sql and plpgsql functions
simple create domain
plpgsql statements, etc:
        assignment
        return
        raise
        null
        perform
        forif

Many things are missing at the moment, in particular
  parsing sql whilst rejecting plpgsql constructs
  group by, having, cte, window keyword, intersect
  joins in updates
  constraints: pk, check, references
  alter and drop statements
  transaction commands
  triggers and trigger functions
  loop
  case statement
  while
  for, integer variant
  error trapping
  cursors
This is a non-exhaustive list

Other current downsides:

The parse tree node types aren't well designed.

No work has been done on correctly rejecting invalid sql and no
thought has been put into error messages and error reporting.

No thought has been given in respects to supporting other sql dialects.
