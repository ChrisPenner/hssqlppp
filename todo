fix basic typechecking so it works again:
  refactor to do numpty inferred types better
  go through existing tests and get working again
get chaos sql parsing and typechecking (add as automated test?) but
  not use as example
library usage examples:
  parse
  typecheck -> result type, check for errors
  code generation
  view catalog/ toy documentation generator
redo website
reorganise code tree




targets for 0.4.0?
fix expression parsing issues?
support most postgresql syntax
reconsider parse tree and ast
production quality parsing and type checking for selects, dml,
   parameterized statements
good documentation and plenty of examples, fix up website + nav
big reorganisation of tests - split into multiple files
review and fix api + names
report generator
better automated testing of extras: chaos sql, example programs/code
reorganised source files, all under src/
super simple build and run tests
simple syntax extensions support: parser plus conversions
more extensive quasi quoting
typesafe haskell wrappers for parameterized statements
build system for syntax extended sql projects
extend the catalog a lot
nullability inference in type checker
rewrite typeconversion.lhs

report generator:
the idea is to have the following for experimentation, evaluate how
   well hssqlppp supports some existing sql, support while developing
   sql (possibly with syntax extensions), and generating
   documentation:
take source sql:
standard postgresql sql in text files
sql taken from postgresql dump from live db
syntax extended sql in text files
do some or all of the following:
parse and type check - report problems
parse, pretty print, reparse and check
generate documentation, catalog
load into postgresql and double check catalog from typechecker
load and dump postgresql, reparse and typecheck for changes

============

future:
profiling, maybe switch parsing library
definitely fix operator parsing - one approach is to adjust parse tree
   after parsing to take into account custom operators and precedence
integrate with haskelldb?
heavily cross linked docs + diagrams
materialized view extension
temporal data extension
generalised inclusions
order independent ddl source
show used catalog, work with module extension as well
better annotation approach
lint tool
modules extension
