= next release

typechecking test fixes todo for this release:

fixup identifiers tests in where in update and delete
fix typechecking for insert, update, delete

with fixupidentifiers, get tpch 15 working, plus some other tests with
  with
ids in where in delete
oid issues? MiscSelects
funtref issues: selectfrom
updates broken - fix ids in set clause
joins: bunch of issues - type compatibility, result fields

review ag code (and other code?) add fixme notes

review test source manually and add in fixme comments to track
 - lots of stuff already commented out
get most/all of the query/dml stuff working again inc. fixup
  identifiers for with

parameterized queries get tests working again

typesafe haskell wrappers

devel tools?

= next + 2

finish off existing typechecking fixes

typechecking fixup, refactoring? -> tests working again
chaos typecheck ok

syntax refactor? - follow sql standard better, split sql and plpgsql
  statements, get rid of separate astanti?

chaos: get parsing, typechecking again, add simple ui which allows ai
  battles + the crazy transformed sql docs
  loaded via compiler tool
  later on: use custom syntax plugins, generate documentation

doctool + website working again?

add extension tests back in ... - ?

= future features
custom syntax plugins for parser
docgen for sql codebase
catalog work - better checking, more items in catalog
fuller parsing: work through pg manual
better quasi quotes
consider adding explicit parens to ast?

fix expression parsing and custom operators: stage one is to do a hack
which supplies the parser with the operator details at run time


reconsider parse tree and ast
good documentation and plenty of examples, fix up website + nav
big reorganisation of tests - split into multiple files
review and fix api + names
report generator
better automated testing of extras: chaos sql, example programs/code
build system for syntax extended sql projects
nullability inference in type checker
rewrite typeconversion.lhs

report generator:
the idea is to have the following for experimentation, evaluate how
   well hssqlppp supports some existing sql, support while developing
   sql (possibly with syntax extensions), and generating
   documentation:
take source sql:
standard postgresql sql in text files
sql taken from postgresql dump from live db
syntax extended sql in text files
do some or all of the following:
parse and type check - report problems
parse, pretty print, reparse and check
generate documentation, catalog
load into postgresql and double check catalog from typechecker
load and dump postgresql, reparse and typecheck for changes

============

future:
profiling, maybe switch parsing library
definitely fix operator parsing - one approach is to adjust parse tree
   after parsing to take into account custom operators and precedence
heavily cross linked docs + diagrams
materialized view extension
temporal data extension
generalised inclusions syntax
order independent ddl source
show used catalog, work with module extension as well
better annotation approach
lint tool
modules extension
