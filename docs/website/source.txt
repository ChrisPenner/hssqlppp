= Guide to source

Get latest development version:

~~~~~{.sh}
bzr branch lp:~jakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk
~~~~~

(This version is sometimes a mess and it's broken on rare occasions).

Uses Parsec for parsing, HDBC for database access, and UUAGC to assist
the type checking (UUAGC is needed if you edit the .ag files).

Comes with a small test suite, which you can run by installing the
executable then running:

~~~~~{.sh}
HsSqlSystem test
~~~~~

TODO:
new plan for source:

src/ for library code
examples/ for example code
test/ for the testing code (which doubles as example code and documentation)
devel/ for development utilities: doctool + extras (testfile gen,
  chaossql, etc.), make antinodes
  annotatesource2
chaos2010/ put the sql and chaos extensions under here to separate out
  from the generic example code

----------

The source is broken up into multiple folders.

Files under src/ are the source files for the library. See [src index](pandoc_source/src/index.txt.html).

Files under examples/ are the source files for the example code. See [example index](pandoc_source/examples/index.txt.html).

Files under devel/ are the source files for some development utilities. TODO: move the doctool folder to this, move the develtools from examples to this hierarchy, then add an index page for these.
