Plan is to write a pandoc document with embedded commands. The build
process will run these commands and embed them into the file before
passing to pandoc. Also want to try to hook into highlighting-kate or
something to do syntax highlighting on haskell or sql text.

For now, all the examples will use hssqlsystem to show results.

TODO on hssqlsystem to get this working:

get input text working: want to be able to pass input text in stdin or
as string argument

get arguments support for database stuff: database name, username,
password

add some commands: expressionType -> returns the expression type

better pretty printer for type errors

better pretty printer for annotations

better pretty printer for catalog updates

----

Start with expressionType, show the types of a few simple expressions,
and some which fail the type check

add some complicated ones, such as big subselects

do a demo of a small set of ddl with basic annotations pretty printed
and then pretty print the catalog updates for this sql
and then pretty print the aast as haskell

demo the extension stuff - show the before and after sql, and show the
haskell source for that extension


more referency section with each command, a description, plus example
usage of each, and examples of all the options, and how to use a
config file


literatize this file some more:
embed these notes into HsSqlSystem.lhs then provide two documentation
processes, one to htmlize without the source as a command line users
guide, and to htmlize the entire file as a programmers guide: extend
this to commands.lhs as the start of a tutorial/ guide for someone
using this as a library.

-> then the system will allow conversion of HsSqlSystem.lhs to html
   for:
end user guide: how to use the program
library user guide: includes source as example code for haskell programmers
haddock generated documentation
and also to produce an executable.

-> need some way to mark which bits are excluded from the end user guide
   need to be able to pandoc-up the file with syntax highlighting also
   need to have some system to preprocess the file to run embedded
   commands and feed the output into the file before it is
   pandoc'd/syntax highlighted.
