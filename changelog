annotated tree

now uses annotations inline in the ast, has rudimentary haddock
documentation, and the beginnings of an API. No progress on parsing or
typechecking since last release.

secondtypechecking

typechecks a fair amount of select statements, and does some type
checking of insert, update, delete and create statements. It can also
take a sql file and parse, type check, and spit it back out with type
checking information interspersed with the statements (but with the
formatting mangled and the comments stripped).


earlytypechecking

hasn't fixed the error messages, but can now type check some select
statements, it includes a command to read a sql file in, type check it
against a database, then pretty print the ast interspersed with the
inferred types of each statement in comments.


lexing

parses with a separate lexer, unfortunately the error messages have
gone wrong.


prealpha1

parses without a separate lexer and gives ok error messages
