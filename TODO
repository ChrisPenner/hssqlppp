= immediate todos:

== for next release
sort out record handling
fix join issues
support multiple files in annotate source and check source
tidy up code and docs as usual

================================================================================

== 2nd next release
fix catalog type, lots of work to make more robust:
  rename environment to catalog
  diff for catalog so we can just see what's been added
  pretty printer for catalog, and for bindings
  deconstruct function to turn a catalog back into a series of updaes
  add annotations to catalog, so can see where bits came from
  do uniqueness testing e.g. disallow two tables with same name, two
   attributes with same name, etc.
fix tests using new catalog approach: don't want to have tests which
use sql to alter catalog then use sql to test the catalog changes have
   been made - use separate tests (more unit-y tests)
to pg roundtrip catalog test: load with one or more sql files, produce
   a catalog diff, then load the sql into pg and read the catalog from
   pg, compare that the read catalog changes are the same as what the
   typechecker has produced.

=== types and internal errors handling

move type check failed to left of either, make node types an either
when there is a type error, add that as separate annotation, and add
type as left typecheckfailed. This way can use the haskell type system
to check we are chaining type check failed properly.
look at all the places where type lists are wrapped in
   unnamedcomposite and get rid of most of them - just use the type
   list directly.
Look at all the contexts where pg types can be used, and split into
   separate haskell types, and use sums to put them back together
   to use the haskell type system better e.g. different set of types
   can be used for an attribute in a table, for a function parameter,
   function return type, variable declaration, etc. - want to use the
   haskell type system to enforce this and get rid of a load of
   runtime checks (mainly the unwrap setof, etc. in typetype).

make sure errors aren't ignored, lots of places where this currently
   happens, e.g. updating environment - these errors need to end up in
   the ast. Get all the env functions to return eithers, and stick
   errors from these in the ast. Convert error calls to either return
   type and stick these errors in the ast.

=== parse/typecheck errors to user

pretty printers for type check failed, work on error messages from parsing
investigate alternative parser libs which can e.g. continue parsing
   after an error to provide more parse errors at once.
write a show for parsec errors which formats the lex tokens and
   expected lists properly (was broken when moved to the separate
   lexer)

================================================================================

== other soon todos

not sure which ones should be done before 0.1 release. rough guide is
   0.1 release should be something that regular sql programmers can
   try out/use without being overwhelmed with half finished/ missing
   bits, and actually see something useful.

=== schemas

think of a way to handle schemas, what about changes to schema search
   path mid code.

=== catalog and bindings annotation

want to add the catalog and current catalog to the annotations, so
   e.g. we can pretty print what exact updates are made to the catalog
   from a ddl statement
Add the current bindings as annotation everywhere, this can be used by
   the ambiguous identifier checks, etc., and to understand errors
also: add annotations to the catalog so we can see where an entity in
   the catalog has come from, what update and what source line
add similar to bindings, so each binding annotation contains a little
   explanation for where each binding has come from (e.g. identifier a
   with type b comes from this tref at source position x,y)

=== casting annotation

for each casting operation, add a log which explains what the relevant
   algorithm has done to either find the appropriate cast or what it's
   considered before failing. (e.g. can provide a list of steps taken
   with the candidate lists in the findcallmatch routine, might be
   useful for errors when it can't find a match, and if it is calling
   an unexpected function instead of the one you want).
add the prototype of the function actually matched at each funcall
   site

=== definition annotations
add sourcepos/reference to definition where each item is referenced
   (table, function, view, identifier binding, etc.)

=== documentation produce

=== null checking

null treatment
Basic motivation is to keep nulls carefully walled off, controlled,
   and be able to catch them when they sneak back into expressions,
   etc.. For each value, etc. we determine statically if it might be
   null. This can be done for return types of functions, fields in a
   select expression, etc.. (will do mappings e.g. if a functions
   inputs are all non null, then the output is non null, etc.). Once
   this is working ok, the second stage is to implement the anti null
   warnings/ errors.
Allow nulls in tables, outer joins, in coalesce, to be produced by
   selects (maybe add or remove from this allowed list, maybe make it
   configurable on a per project basis).
Never allow nulls to be an argument to a function call, (including
   ops, keyword ops, etc.). So every time you have a field being used
   in an expression and it cannot be statically verified to be non
   null, you have to insert a coalesce or fix it in some other way.
So nulls can still be used to represent optional values, n/a,
   etc.. and output to clients doing selects, but there is no need to
   grapple with:
* 3vl (or whatever it is that sql uses instead),
* what the result of a function call is if the some or all the
  arguments are null,
* what the result of a sum aggregate is if some of the values are null,
* etc.,
because none of these things are allowed.

=== support variadic args for functions

also, default args?

=== typechecking completeness

make sure everything that parses is typechecked as much as possible
(make some notes on this)

=== do sql support todo

fill in the main gaps, some notes below
want to cover '90% of regularly used sql', no attempt for v0.1 to be
   comprehensive or nearly comprehensive

=== shadowed identifier test

use the bindings annotation to add warnings

=== modules extension

stage 1: set the current module with a function call
do creating the module and adding objects to the current module using
   extension instead of the sql functions used at the moment
find a way to annotate the source with modules stuff, want to use it
   for documentation
stage 2: add import/export stuff and check this

=== other extensions for chaos
mark generated code with annotation: make annotation types open with type
   class or something? - can get rid of typeerrora, statementinfoa
   wrappers this way
check for all ddl, etc. run in functions/executes and turn into
   extensions so the type checker can see these things
out of order definitions: want to write defs in any order and
   have the extension reorder them into something which can be loaded
   into postgres
finish create_var extension: add constraints
constraint system: make a bunch of stuff automatic, like using 'pg
   accelerators'
add notify triggers automatically, including for views
convert the sql tests (maybe some of the haskell tests) into static
   checks on the ast
find a better way to work with the tables with null fields:
  initial values - the copy statements are completely unreadable and
   uneditable
  what else?
crufty bits to try and simplify: turn sequence progression, action
   valid tables, ai
see if can make the multiple update hack more automatic


=== development/deployment support:
build file for development, just lists sql files in order, and lists
   which extensions are used
deployment: use system to load all sql via extensions into pg, then
to a regular pg dump which can then be deployed.


=== crufty bits to tidy
ag files constantly need fixing up for documentation and code clarity
syb stuff is a bit messy in astannotations (maybe use uniplate here to
   reduce dependencies?)
tidy the annotating functions in astinternals, implement then in terms
   of eachother
review local bindings use and decide how much logic to implement
   inside the local bindings module rather than eg. tablerefs.ag
want to stop having to write explicit backtrees everywhere. The key to
   fixing this is some way to read the existing annotation and supply
   an altered annotation within uuagc code
think about how doing multiple passes could help (e.g. star
   expansion).
think about where can use quickcheck
review when function bodies are typechecked - see if can do better
annotatesource function is a mess, also, make it overwrite it's own
   annotations instead of adding them so you can run it over a file
   multiple times.

=== testing
work on making the tests more comprehensive, want a test for each
   branch/option where feasible

=== write some automated tests for various roundtrips
add script to test chaos sql in various ways: parse roundtrip, load
   into database via psql and via hssqlppp comparison, and check
   catalog consistency

=== do way to produce aast from live database

use psql dump, and then can do type checks, lint checks, produce
   documentation

=== api
review/work on api and do haddock

=== prepare code for use by non haskell programmers + user docs
provide installation instructions
do usage documentation file, want to run code embedded in doc source
   and have results outputted to html output.

=== prepare code for use by haskell client programmers:
user docs as above for using the parser, the extension system, the
   annotator and annotations, examples for generating sql and writing
   extensions, etc.

=== ? place holder statements

=== precedence and operator parsing
add missing operators to parser
see if @ as prefix and infix just works in parsec
some a_expr and b_expr support properly by looking at pg grammar file


---------
some new random notes

literal sql mode, with workspace idea: can write code/sql inline
in the source, and run it against a database and view the results
inline like in some text books where code is executed then the results
printed inline into the result - so this is a partial replacement for
   ghci, emacs haskell-mode ghci, psql, maybe bash, maybe ide, and
   also a runtime diagnosis tool which can be embedded into production
   exes. Pretty ambitious, need to focus on useful and easy features.

variant:
hssqlppp workspace: text view can type in commands and get results
   back, create multiple workspaces and they're persistent, maybe
   a wrapper round ghci but not conventional repl style, more like
   entering elisp and evaluating it in emacs? want to use
   as replacement for the ghci thing in emacs, and as a shell for working with
   the ast stuff and actual databases

use template haskell to simplify generics in extensions: cases and
   replacements are a bit verbose and difficult to write and read?


= parse and/or type check todo list:
(rough/incomplete)
"identifier"
6.5e-5
type 'string' style type cast
[:] slice
missing keyword ops
default template1 operators should all parse
agg(all expr) agg(distinct expr), agg(*)
window frame clauses, named windows
parse inside string literals when cast, for common types
multidimensional arrays
default values
serial
make sure can type check everything that parses
constraint names
provide list of keys in info for create/alter table: include unique
   not null and serials
type check fks, and other constraints
alter table: add/remove column
                        constraint
                        default value
                        column type
                        rename column
                        rename table
what other alters/creates
views, functions, operators, types, domains, triggers, rules
selects:
implicit joins
group by, having + group by with unaggregated and aggregated fields
distinct, on
order by - do properly
limit, offset
with queries
type modifiers
data type names with spaces in them
timestamps
schemas
alternative text for true and false
enums
geometric types weird syntax
composites: selector variants, rowctors, component get/update
do all keyword and template1 operators
any/some/all subqueries and arrays
check over rowwise comparisons
indexes: create/alter/drop

another todo list:
catalog:
constraints, pg_constraint
triggers
rules
indexes
add drops for all creates
review which alters to add
default columns values + insert checking
support pks,fks better
support serial properly
type modifiers
sequences
enums
listen, notify, pg_listener
blocks in plpgsql, assignments in declarations, not null checking
strict in into
lables, loops, exit, continue
raise % counts
create schema

once all this is done, work on documenting precisely what is supported
   and what isn't.

================================================================================

example for generating sql code from haskell using the ast
get database loader and typesafe access generators good enough to use
   in chaos
example usage of each of these
look at the error message formatting, particularly try to fix the
   parser errors so they make more sense
add annotation field to most ast nodes, store type and source
   positioning in this field, fix parser to add lots of accurate
   positioning information when parsing.
make sure the lint process works on text dumps of databases.
try checking the sample databases: http://pgfoundry.org/projects/dbsamples/


================================================================================

some syntax todo, not organised:

------------
add support for following sql syntax (+ type checking)
alter table, common variations
create index
create rule
create trigger
+ drops for all creates
+ maybe alters?
ctes
loop, exit, labels
easy ones: transactions, savepoints, listen
prepare, execute + using
some more:
create or replace
alter table
transactions: begin, checkpoint, commit, end, rollback
cursors: declare, open, fetch, move, close, where current of
copy - parse properly
create database
create index
create rule
create trigger + plpgsql support
grant,revoke
listen, notify, unlisten
prepare, execute
savepoint, release savepoint, rollback to savepoint
set, reset
set constraints
set role
set transaction
correlated subquery attrs

plpgsql

blocks which aren't at the top level of a function
% types
strict on intos
not null for var defs
exception
execute using
get diagnostics
return query execute
raise missing bits
out params
elsif
loop
exit
labels
reverse, by in for
for in execute

expressions:
process string escapes, support dollar quoting and other quoting more
   robustly in the pretty printer
full user operator support (?)
fix expression parser properly to handle things like between - see
   grammar in pg source for info on how to do this
[:] array slices
aggregate: all and distinct
multi dimensional arrays: selectors and subscripting
missing keyword operators
datetime extract
time zone
subquery operators: any, some, all
in general, parsing operators is wrong, the lexer needs to be able to
   lex sequences of symbols into single/multiple operators correctly,
   what happens at the moment is a kludge, also, general operator
   parsing will change how operators are represented in the ast

================================================================================

some other random ideas:

parser, converter and pretty printer for explain output, want to view
   how a query is executed in human readable pseudocode. Add lint type
   checks, etc. to this, which can suggest ways to rewrite the query
   to get better performance. Another idea is to make the dependencies
   on the values in the tables more explicit, so you can see how much
   the data can change before another plan is chosen, or you can see a
   bad assumption about the kind of data the query will be run on.

incorporate pg regression test sql into parsing and type checking
   tests - can run the roundtrip tests on them, check the
   documentation generator, etc.

redo cabal file to add compile time options: exes, pg support, tests
 or split into separate packages?

work on error reporting, add tests for malformed sql, already some
   tests and plan for more for sql which fails type checks.

want to report multiple parse errors, perhaps can bodge this because
   of the property that ';' can only appear inside a string or
   comment, or otherwise at the end of a statement, so add some code
   to jump to the next end of statement looking ';' and continue to
   parse to end of file in an attempt to catch at least some further
   syntax errors

get property checker working again - one problem is that the pretty
   printer will reject some asts (which the parser cannot
   produce), and the parser will probably reject some invalid sql that
   the pretty printer will happily produce from some asts.

plpgsql on 'roids:
write libraries in haskell, and then write syntax extensions for
   plpgsql using the extension mechanism to access these libs from
   extended plpgsql e.g. ui lib written in haskell, accessed by syntax
   extensions in plpgsql then can write the database and ui all in the
   same source code in the same language, with first class support for
   properly typed relation valued expressions, avoiding multiple
   languages and mapping/'impedance mismatch' between database types
   and types in the language you write the ui in.
