# Compiling and running the tests

A full compile from scratch involves the following steps:

recompile the AstInternals.hs from AstInternals.ag et al using
uuagc. See src/lib/Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/AstInternals.ag for instructions

update the antinodes using devel/MakeAntiNodes.lhs, see this file for
instructions

Compile the tests executable using cabal:

~~~~
cabal configure -ftests
cabal build
~~~~

The run the tests using:

~~~~
dist/build/Tests/Tests
~~~~

expect 12 failures at the moment, which are in the broken typechecker,
and not likely to be fixed for a while.
