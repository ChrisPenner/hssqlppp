= Guide to source

Uses Parsec for parsing, HDBC for database access, and UUAGC to assist
the type checking (UUAGC is needed if you edit the .ag files).

Comes with a small test suite.

* [Source code](source/src/index.txt.html)
* [Test source code](source/tests/index.txt.html)
* [Example code](source/examples/index.txt.html)

The generated files are:
