Here are some limited notes on working on the source of hssqlppp:

Get the source
==============

Please use the code from git to develop with, one way to get it is to
run:

~~~~~
git clone https://github.com/JakeWheat/hssqlppp.git
~~~~~

Build the library
=================

Once you have the source, you can build the library using cabal

~~~~~
cabal configure && cabal build
~~~~~

Rebuild the generated files for the syntax
==========================================

If you edit the ag files, you need to rebuild AstInternal.hs. First
make sure you have uuagc installed:

~~~~~
cabal install uuagc
~~~~~

Then use the makefile:

~~~~~
make src/Database/HsSqlPpp/Internals/AstInternal.hs
~~~~~

The makefile hasn't been heavily tested yet. If you have any problems
with unrecognised modules, the complete list of packages referenced is
in the Makefile (it may be missing build tools, such as cpphs, this
hasn't been checked yet).

To just rebuild the library in the usual way after editing the ag
files use:

~~~~~
make src/Database/HsSqlPpp/Internals/AstInternal.hs
cabal build
~~~~~

There is one further generated file, DefaultTemplate1Catalog.lhs. You
don't usually need to regenerate this, but this is how you do it:

~~~~~
make regenDefaultTemplate1Catalog
~~~~~

Build and run the tests
=======================

You can build and run the tests using the makefile:

~~~~~
make tests
~~~~~

or to just build the tests, then run manually:

~~~~~
make src-extra/tests/Tests
src-extra/tests/Tests
~~~~~

Background reading
==================

The main things used in hssqlppp are: parsec, uuagc, generics,
quasiquoting, pretty printing.

Parsec is used for parsing:
Here is a tutorial for parsec which is outdated but isn't too bad for
getting started: <http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html>

Chapter in Real World Haskell on parsec:
<http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html>

UUAGC is used to assist the typechecking. It is also used to define
the ast data types:
<http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/HUT/AttributeGrammarSystem>

A tutorial, not that easy to follow:
<http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/HUT/AttributeGrammarManual>

Pretty printing:
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty>

Generics:
Just uses a bit of this at the moment, mostly uses uniplate:
<http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/uniplate/>

Quasiquotation:
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Quasiquotation>

The automated tests use test-framework and HUnit.

Source overview
===============

weird bits:

* uuagc
* lexing/parsing split (uses parsec to lex, then parsec again to
  parse)
* typechecker: fixupidentifiers
