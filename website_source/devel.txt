Here are some limited notes on working on the source of hssqlppp:

Get the source
==============

Please use the code from git to develop with, one way to get the code
is to run:

~~~~~
git clone https://github.com/JakeWheat/hssqlppp.git
~~~~~

Build the library
=================

Once you have the source, build using cabal

~~~~~
cabal configure && cabal build
~~~~~

Rebuild the generated files for the syntax
==========================================

If you edit the ag files, use the build.sh script. This rebuilds two
of the generated files: AstInternal.hs which is generated from the .ag
files, and AstAnti.hs which is generated from AstInternal.hs.

There is one further generated file,
DefaultTemplate1Catalog.lhs. There isn't a straightforward way to
rebuild this at the moment.

Build and run the tests
=======================

To build and run the tests, use:

~~~~~
cd src-extra
cabal configure && cabal build
dist/build/Tests/Tests
~~~~~

There are a lot of regressions which haven't been fixed, so expect
lots of failures (~50). These should all be typechecking failures.

Background reading
==================

The main components used in hssqlppp are: parsec, uuagc, generics,
quasiquoting, pretty printing.

Parsec is used for parsing:
Here is a outdated tutorial for parsec which isn't too bad for getting
started: <http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html>

Chapter in Real World Haskell on parsec:
<http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html>

UUAGC is used to assist the typechecking. It is also used to define
the ast data types:
<http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/HUT/AttributeGrammarSystem>

A tutorial, not that easy to follow:
<http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/HUT/AttributeGrammarManual>

Pretty printing:
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty>

Generics:
Just uses a bit of this at the moment, mostly uses uniplate:
<http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/uniplate/>

Quasiquotation:
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Quasiquotation>

The automated tests use test-framework and HUnit.

Source overview
===============

weird bits:

* uuagc
* astanti
* lexing/parsing split
* typechecker: fixupidentifiers
