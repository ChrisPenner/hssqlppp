adding full chaos to the project:
h7c hardcoded to chaos at the moment, want to remove this when basics
  are working
add generic extensions to src-extra/extensions folder
src-extra/chaos:
./sql/ sql files
./extensions/ chaos specific extensions
./tests/ automated tests for chaos
./gui/ simple gui which can run ai battles to show the code actually works
       (no animation, no sounds for now)
