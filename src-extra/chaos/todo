adding full chaos to the project:
h7c hardcoded to chaos at the moment, want to remove this when basics
  are working
add generic extensions to src-extra/extensions folder
src-extra/chaos:
./sql/ sql files
./extensions/ chaos specific extensions
./tests/ automated tests for chaos
./gui/ simple gui which can run ai battles to show the code actually works
       (no animation, no sounds for now)

milestones:

output sql in format that goes in database ok

get automated tests running again

adjust h7c so info is not hardcoded

add simple chaos gui - use hssqlppp typesafe access, not haskelldb

typecheck chaos code successfully -> no type errors plus matching
  catalog

loader which loads straight into pglib without psql
