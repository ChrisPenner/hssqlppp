This file contains the ast nodes, which aren't brilliantly designed,
and the attribute grammar system which uses the Utrecht University
Attribute Grammar system:

http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/HUT/AttributeGrammarSystem
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Monad.Reader/Issue4/Why_Attribute_Grammars_Matter

There are no source positions in the ast at the moment. The grammar
system is intended to act a as type checker, and to do other static
checks for the time being, which is a work in progress and in a very
early state.

These ast nodes a are both used as the result of successful parsing,
and as the input to the pretty printer.

Lots of invalid sql is currently allowed if you construct the asts in
code, the parser isn't quite as lenient, but still can parse and not
complain about a lot of invalid sql.

use

uuagc -dcfws Ast.ag

to generate a new Ast.hs from this file

(install uuagc with
cabal install uuagc
)

Tip: after you've compiled this file with the above command, you can
get loads of warnings from ghc if you're the sort who enables
these. Using haskell-mode from emacs usually results in compiles being
really slow just cos emacs outputs all these warnings _really_ slowly,
and also any real warnings and errors can get drowned out. You can get
rid of these warnings by ghc compiling the produced Ast.hs on the
command line:
ghc -c Ast.hs

does the job, you can then compile from emacs and it will use the .o
file and you won't get any warnings about generated code in Ast.hs (if
the .o file gets stale, ghc / haskell mode will do the right thing and
ignore it, but it can't tell if the Ast.hs has gotten stale wrt
Ast.ag)

SQL top level statements

everything is chucked in here, in particular this means that many places where
a select can appear inside another statement (e.g. a subselect), you can
instead put any statement - this type checks but is totally invalid.

TODO: think about having separate parse tree which the parser produces,
and a proper set of ast types with no pollution from concrete syntax
or parsing considerations


Anything that is represented in the ast as some sort of name plus a
list of expressions as arguments is treated as the same type of node:
FunCall.

This includes
symbol operators
regular function calls
keyword operators e.g. and, like (ones which can be parsed as normal
  syntactic operators)
unusual syntax operators, e.g. between
unusual syntax function calls e.g. substring(x from 5 for 3)
arrayctors e.g. array[3,5,6]
rowctors e.g. ROW (2,4,6)
array subscripting

All of these could be considered concrete syntax variants of function
calls, which take none, one or more expressions as arguments, and
return a single expression as the result.

Divide them up into different flavours (corresponding to the FunName
algebraic data type constructors), which is guided by what the pretty
printer needs to work (maybe this is a bit inelegant):
all regular function calls like [name](args,...) are SimpleFuns
all regular operators (symbols, regular prefix,infix and postfix) are
  treated the same
arrayctors, rowctors, array subscript are each given their own ctor
all the standard keyword operators (prefix, infix and postfix) are
  given their own ctor
each unusual syntax keyword operator is given its own ctor
each unusual syntax function call is given its own ctor

keyword operators (regular prefix, infix and postfix):
and, or, not
is null, is not null, isnull, notnull
is distinct from, is not distinct from
is true, is not true,is false, is not false, is unknown, is not unknown
like, not like, ilike, not ilike
similar to, not similar to
in, not in (don't include these here since the argument isn't always an expr)

unusual syntax operators and fn calls
between, not between, between symmetric
overlay, substring, trim
any, some, all

attribute descriptions:

sourcePos - holds the source position used in messages, not very
accurate at the moment, just gives you the position of the first
character in the current statement

messages - used to collect error messages, also to be used for
warnings (e.g. $1 position argument used when all args have aliases),
and notices - will probably use these to highlight dodgy sql
code and idioms.

= static tests

Problem 1: can't have two sem statements for the same node type which
both add messages, and then the messages get combined to provide the
final message list attribute value for that node. Workaround is
instead of having each check in it's own section, to combine them all
into one SEM.

Problem 2: no shorthand to combine what the default rule for messages
would be and then add a bit extra - so if you want all the children
messages, plus possiby an extra message or two, have to write out the
default rule in full explicitly. Can get round this by writing out
loads of code.

Both the workarounds to these seem a bit tedious and error prone, and
will make the code much less readable. Maybe need a preprocessor to
produce the ag file?

Type checking

the current type checking approach doesn't quite match how SQL
works. What it will do when the first version is finished, is possibly
read the database catalogs, then read the source script(s) and
statically check the types are consistent, as if the scripts are
declarative descriptions rather than a series of imperative
commands. In particular, this means that it won't be able to type
check dynamically generated tables, functions, views, etc., in a sense
it is static whereas SQL is dynamic.

One possible solution to this is to defer type checking and use the
database to load the script bit by bit whilst type checking as bits
are loaded.

Part of the syntax extension system design is to provide some
specialized methods for generating sql code in a way that can be type
checked statically without having to run the code.

dynamically typed record (can be any composite type)

custom create type types

domains:
the point of domains is you can't put constraints on types, but you
can wrap a type up in a domain and put a constraint on it there


== literals/selectors
needs some notes for parsing and checking the various ways to
represent literals/selectors of various types in source code, e.g. ROW
for composite types, and e.g. '{}' for empty array, etc.

== notes on type checking types
prectypename: only for certain types
check types refered to appear in type catalog cache

- build this early in the checking process, want to feed in a default
  list, or load it from a database, then supplement it with the new
  type definitions in the ast

looking at the typename nodes:
check context: setof can only appear as return type of function
what other restrictions on context?
some types refer to other types:
e.g. domains, composite types, enum, row types?

how does pg treat row types: are they all the same, are ones with the
same number of elements the same, are they only the same when they
have the same number and types of elements?

is it worth splitting types into scalar and type generators, and
handling them differently?

how does name and structural equivalence apply to pg types?

== notes on implicit casting

type categories boolean, numeric, string, bitstring, datetime,
timespan, geometric, network, and user-defined

implicit 'functional' casts


=== types catalog
select typname from pg_type;
restrict this?


=== basic type checking
at the moment - just check type exists in predetermined list of type
names
todo: option to read types from database catalog at time of type
checking
todo: collect type names from current source file to check against
also


with ts as
(select pg_catalog.format_type(t.oid, null) as name
  from pg_catalog.pg_type t
  where (t.typrelid = 0
         or (select c.relkind = 'c'
             from pg_catalog.pg_class c
             where c.oid = t.typrelid))
        and not exists(select 1 from pg_catalog.pg_type el
                       where el.oid = t.typelem and el.typarray = t.oid)
        and pg_catalog.pg_type_is_visible(t.oid)
  order by name)
select '"' || name || '",' from ts;

where need to check type names?
casts, create table attrs, create type (composite) attrs, create
domain, create function: param defs, returns, var defs, drop function


Type aliases

Some types in postgresql have multiple names. I think this is
hardcoded in their parser. There are two canonicalize routines to work
with these aliases.

The first one is for the ast, these canonical names have been chosen
arbitrarily, but with some guidelines: where there is a choice, prefer
the sql standard name, where there are multiple sql standard names,
choose the most concise or common one.

The second one is for postgresql, and converts type names into the
name which appears in the pg_type catalog table.

ast canonical names:
numbers:
int2, int4/integer, int8 -> smallint, int, bigint
numeric, decimal -> numeric
float(1) to float(24), real -> float(24)
float, float(25) to float(53), double precision -> float
serial, serial4 -> int
bigserial, serial8 -> bigint
character varying(n), varchar(n)-> varchar(n)
character(n), char(n) -> char(n)

I think there has to be another layer of type equivalences, e.g. for
type checking expressions, text and varchar are equivalent, domains
and their underlying type are equivalent.


Need to filter this list since they are all treated as scalar type
names atm, and need to treat scalars, composites, domains, special
types differently

= literals

This isn't right. The type of a literal is determined by its
context. The lexer produces the following flavours of tokens which are
relevant:
integer
non integer number
string

This follows how the pg parser works. The types of these are
determined by context, and then can have implicit casts applied.

An integer token, with implicit casting, can effectively have any
number type (and maybe other custom types also?).

A non integer number can have any non integer number type in the same
way (e.g. real, double precision, usertype?)

Strings is where it gets really messy, since a string token is
regarded as an unknown type, and can represent a literal of all sorts
of types, including numbers, text, arrays, row types, all sorts of
customer and user types.

Since we don't know the type until the type checking time, we can't
e.g. push the types into the parser, by determining the type of a
string token then checking that its text value parses ok to a value of
that type.

Will have to add some polymorphic type placeholders to be resolved
later, and add parsing of string literals to different kinds of types
here in the type checker so that we can syntax check/type check these
sorts of things.

TODO

some non type-check checks:
check plpgsql only in plpgsql function
do all containment checks above
orderby in top level select only
copy followed immediately by copydata iff stdin, copydata only follows
copy from stdin
args to raise, etc, same number as placeholders in string
natural with correct join types
no natural with onexpr in joins
constraint column ref checks?
typename -> setof (& fix parsing), what else like this?
expressions: positionalarg in function, window function only in select
 list top level

review all ast checks, and see if we can also catch them during
parsing (e.g. typeName parses setof, but this should only be allowed
for a function return, and we can make this a parse error when parsing
from source code rather than checking a generated ast. This needs
judgement to say whether a parse error is better than a check error, I
think for setof it is, but e.g. for a continue not in a loop (which
could be caught during parsing) works better as a check error, looking
at the error message the user will get. This might be wrong, haven't
thought too carefully about it yet).

Type checking

(Have no idea what I am doing, just going to try to bluff it, then
learn how to do it properly later)

Create a algebraic data type to represent types.

Add a type called Unknown which always passes. Add this to everything
by default - now all code type checks and we can add proper type
checking piecemeal.

Start with tables, and then simple select * from table, select a,b from table.
Then maybe do some simple expressions.

Add separate function to return the inferred types of statementlists/
expressions, etc., so the checkAst checks the types are consistent,
and them have something like getStatementType, getStatementsType,
getExpressionType (which works for selects and relation valued
expressions as well as scalars, tuples, etc).


TODO: canonicalize ast process, as part of type checking produces a canonicalized ast which:
all casts are explicit
all names fully qualified
all types use canonical names
literal values and selectors in one form (use row style?)
what else?

Canonical form only defined for type consistent asts.

This canonical form should pretty print and parse back to the same
form, and type check correctly.
