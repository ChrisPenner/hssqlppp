= Overview of the library source:

The files in the folder
[Database/HsSqlPpp/](Database/HsSqlPpp/)
are all the public api files. Some of these contain the implementation
code, and some are just forwarding modules.

The main interesting files are:

pretty printer:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/PrettyPrinter.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/PrettyPrinter.lhs.html)

sql types:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeType.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeType.lhs.html)

quasiquoting:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/SqlQuote.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/SqlQuote.lhs.html)

main sql parsing:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/Parsing/ParserInternal.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/Parsing/ParserInternal.lhs.html)

sql lexing:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/Parsing/Lexer.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/Parsing/Lexer.lhs.html)

sql ast types:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/AstInternal.ag](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/AstInternal.ag.html)

a generated and slighly mangled copy of these ast types to support
antiquotation:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/AstAnti.hs](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/AstAnti.hs.html)

the code to create and query catalogs:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/Catalog/CatalogInternal.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/Catalog/CatalogInternal.lhs.html)

code to create and query local bindings - used for parameters and
variables in plpgsql functions, as well as for passing the types of
identifiers around inside statements (e.g. getting the names and types
from a table ref to pass to a select list inside a select statement)
Most of the logic for type checking joins is in here
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeChecking/LocalBindings.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeChecking/LocalBindings.lhs.html)

the type checking code is split up into multiple ag files in the
following folder:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeChecking/](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeChecking/)

the main hairy bit of type checking (apart from joins),
includes the complicated overloaded function matching and implicit
cast and conversion logic:
[Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeChecking/TypeConversion.lhs](Database/HsSqlPpp/AstInternals/TypeChecking/TypeConversion.lhs.html)
