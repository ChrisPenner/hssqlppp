typenames - translate from the syntactic typenames to semantic types

typenames always refer to existing types, aren't used syntactically to
when creating new types, so lookup the type in the catalog here to
check it exists

for a simple type:
get an either [type error] type

if it is left error - want to attach the error to the typename
node. don't want to duplicate this error to the name node or the
parent node

if it is right type: send the type to the parent. don't want to
annotated the typename or the name with the type since this annotation
isn't applicable to either node type

TODO: add tests for cast which make sure there is only one type in the
tree when successful, and only one type error in the tree when the
typename isn't recognised
