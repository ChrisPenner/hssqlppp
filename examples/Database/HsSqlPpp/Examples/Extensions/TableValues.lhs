Currently, just some notes.

read only tables, uses transition constraints to enforce. Also - see
about adding this to the type checking to verify statically.

maybe base on another extension which supports 'denormalized 6nf
relvars'

see the copy statements in the chaos sql - ugly, unreadable and
uneditable - this is the motivation
