[SQL source annotator](AnnotateSource2): really rough processor which
takes sql source with custom syntax, and attempts to output the target
sql which has been transformed rendered in html, while preserving as
much of the original source as possible.

[MakeAntiNodes.lhs](MakeAntiNodes.lhs): some code to take the ast with
antiquote support, and create an alternative tree without the antinode
bits, and create a conversion function to take an antiquote ast and
convert it into a normal one.

[MakeWebsite.lhs](MakeWebsite.lhs): some code to generate a website
from literate source and a few extra markdown files, mainly uses
pandoc.
