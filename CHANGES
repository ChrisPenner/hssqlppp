HEAD

start rewriting the Catalog module, Annotation type, typechecking code
  and typeconversion code from scratch - should be much clearer code
  and more functionality
lots of improvements to the Type module, types and documentation
better haddock documentation
parser/syntax additions and fixes:
split functions and operators into different ctors (App, BinaryOp,
  PrefixOp, etc.)
rename some badly named ctors in the syntax
use names in LiftApp

0.4.0
Released 30/09/2011

lots of breaking changes to the ast types
change ast for into statements
change ast for update statements
add support for distinct and order by in aggregate calls
change the syntax for names, identifiers, etc., much better handling
  of qualification and quoted names in the parser and syntax
handle asterix in syntax and parser differently, and will give syntax
  error in most places when the asterix isn't valid during parsing
support parsing sql server select top n syntax (parses to postgres
  limit abstract syntax)
add a reasonably comprehensive makefile which handles the generated
  files, compiling and running the tests and other tasks much more
  straightforwardly, replaces the various build scripts and the cabal
  file for the tests
remove the functions from Annotation module which are trivial wrappers
  around uniplate functions
remove ugly system for implementing antiquotes in the syntax - now is
  much more straightforward
bug/regression fixes:
fix parsing 'for 1..10' without spaces
fix pretty printing (x).y member reference in scalar
  expressions (was missing parens before)
fix typechecking for update and insert statements
fix typechecking for natural joins
fix typechecking for parameterized queries/dml
fix typechecking for most joins
fix typechecking for non composite function table refs
main deficiency for typechecking expressions remaining is composite
  and set of composite returning functions in tablerefs.
fix parsing of substring when it uses regular function call syntax
  (i.e. substring(a,b,c) rather than substring(a from b for c)
fix for the syntax of the directions in order by in window functions
fix broken select into parsing
parsing of :: cast operator has been improved in some cases
