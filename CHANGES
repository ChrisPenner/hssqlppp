unreleased development

Focus: clean up some of the api
       complete haddocks
       clean up/rewrite lots of the typechecking internals
       start taking the sql server syntax support a bit more seriously
lots of api changes, including the parsing and typechecking functions
  and the ast
switch to using Data.Text.Lazy.Text to parse from and pretty print to
typechecking has regressed further, focus is on rock solid
  typechecking of queryexprs and dml statements only (typechecking of
  ddl and plpgsql are completely broken)
start rewriting the Catalog module, Annotation type, typechecking code
  and typeconversion code from scratch - should be much clearer code
  and more functionality.
lots of improvements to the Type module, types and documentation
better haddock documentation
better documentation plus named fields in some more types such as
  QueryExpr and Annotation
parser/syntax additions and fixes:
split functions and operators into different ctors (App, BinaryOp,
  PrefixOp, etc.), now parses prefix - as "-" instead of hacky "u-"
  because of this
represent parens in scalarexpr in the ast
rename some badly named ctors in the syntax
use names in LiftApp
limited explicit support for sql server syntax/tsql as separate
  dialect using flag passed to parser, typechecker and pretty printer
source code tree is better organised and documented:
  split code into hssqlppp, hssqlppp-pg, hssqlppp-th packages plus
  other bits
  use much better method of autogenerating makefile rules
  use cabal test sections for automated tests
  improved build system all around
  package dependencies much better handled
improved handling of reserved keywords
add flags to typechecking to control the tree rewrites:
  add qualifiers to identifiers
  add select item aliases
  replace * in select list with expanded identifier list
better parsing for operators without whitespace, e.g. is now able to
  parse a<>-1 as a <> -1

0.4.1
Released 09/04/2014

Update 0.4.0 to work with ghc 7.6 and 7.8

0.4.0
Released 30/09/2011

lots of compatibility breaking changes to the ast types
change ast for into statements
change ast for update statements
add support for distinct and order by in aggregate calls
change the syntax for names, identifiers, etc., much better handling
  of qualification and quoted names in the parser and syntax
handle asterix in syntax and parser differently, and will give syntax
  error in most places when the asterix isn't valid during parsing
support parsing sql server select top n syntax (parses to postgres
  limit abstract syntax)
add a reasonably comprehensive makefile which handles the generated
  files, compiling and running the tests and other tasks much more
  straightforwardly, replaces the various build scripts and the cabal
  file for the tests
remove the functions from Annotation module which are trivial wrappers
  around uniplate functions
remove ugly system for implementing antiquotes in the syntax - now is
  much more straightforward
bug/regression fixes:
fix parsing 'for 1..10' without spaces
fix pretty printing (x).y member reference in scalar
  expressions (was missing parens before)
fix typechecking for update and insert statements
fix typechecking for natural joins
fix typechecking for parameterized queries/dml
fix typechecking for most joins
fix typechecking for non composite function table refs
main deficiency for typechecking expressions remaining is composite
  and set of composite returning functions in tablerefs.
fix parsing of substring when it uses regular function call syntax
  (i.e. substring(a,b,c) rather than substring(a from b for c)
fix for the syntax of the directions in order by in window functions
fix broken select into parsing
parsing of :: cast operator has been improved in some cases

  the defaultTemplate1Catalog file yet)

get rid of unused cpp dependency and some other unused extensions
add some limited docs for hacking hssqlppp
