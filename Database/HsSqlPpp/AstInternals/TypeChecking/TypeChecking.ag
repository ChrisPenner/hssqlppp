This file contains the attr and sem definitions, which do the type
checking, etc..

A lot of the haskell code has been moved into other files:
TypeCheckingH, AstUtils.lhs, it is intended that only small amounts of
code appear (i.e. one-liners) inline in this file, and larger bits go
in AstUtils.lhs. These are only divided because the attribute grammar
system uses a custom syntax with a custom preprocessor. These
guidelines aren't followed very well.

The current type checking approach doesn't quite match how SQL
works. The main problem is that you can e.g. exec create table
statements inside a function. This is something that the type checker
will probably not be able to deal for a while if ever. (Will need
hooks into postgresql to do this properly, which might not be
impossible...).

Once most of the type checking is working, all the code and
documentation will be overhauled quite a lot. Alternatively put, this
code is in need of better documentation and organisation, and serious
refactoring.

An unholy mixture of Maybe, Either, Either/Error Monad and TypeCheckFailed
is used to do error handling.

One of the common patterns is when type checking a node:

first check any types of subnodes which it depends on, if any are
typecheckfailed, then this node's type is typecheckfailed and we stop
there.

otherwise, calculate the type of this node, or get an error if there
is a problem, this is put into loc.tpe which is Either TypeError
Type. Then some common code takes this value and sets the node type to
the type or typecheckfailed if tpe is left, and if it is left add a
type error annotation also.

= main attributes used

Here are the main attributes used in the type checking:

env is used to chain the environments up and down the tree, to allow
access to the catalog information, and to store the in environment
identifier names and types e.g. inside a select expression.

annotatedTree is used to create a copy of the ast with the type,
etc. annotations.

old stuff:

================================================================================

= static tests

Try to use a list of message data types to hold all sorts of
information which works its way out to the top level where the client
code gets it. Want to have the lists concatenated together
automatically from subnodes to parent node, and then to be able to add
extra messages to this list at each node also.

Problem 1: can't have two sem statements for the same node type which
both add messages, and then the messages get combined to provide the
final message list attribute value for that node. You want this so
that e.g. that different sorts of checks appear in different
sections. Workaround is instead of having each check in it's own
section, to combine them all into one SEM.

Problem 2: no shorthand to combine what the default rule for messages
would be and then add a bit extra - so if you want all the children
messages, plus possibly an extra message or two, have to write out the
default rule in full explicitly. Can get round this by writing out
loads of code.

Both the workarounds to these seem a bit tedious and error prone, and
will make the code much less readable. Maybe need a preprocessor to
produce the ag file? Alternatively, just attach the messages to each
node (so this appears in the data types and isn't an attribute, then
have a tree walker collect them all). Since an annotation field in
each node is going to be added anyway, so each node can be labelled
with a type, will probably do this at some point.

================================================================================

= inloop testing

inloop - use to check continue, exit, and other commands that can only
appear inside loops (for, while, loop)

the only nodes that really need this attribute are the ones which can
contain statements

The inloop test is the only thing which uses the messages atm. It
shouldn't, at some point inloop testing will become part of the type
checking.

This is just some example code, will probably do something a lot more
heavy weight like symbolic interpretation - want to do all sorts of
loop, return, nullability, etc. analysis.

TODO

some non type-check checks:
check plpgsql only in plpgsql function
orderby in top level select only
copy followed immediately by copydata iff stdin, copydata only follows
  copy from stdin
count args to raise, etc., check same number as placeholders in string
no natural with onexpr in joins
typename -> setof (& fix parsing), what else like this?
expressions: positionalarg in function, window function only in select
 list top level

review all ast checks, and see if we can also catch them during
parsing (e.g. typeName parses setof, but this should only be allowed
for a function return, and we can make this a parse error when parsing
from source code rather than checking a generated ast. This needs
judgement to say whether a parse error is better than a check error, I
think for setof it is, but e.g. for a continue not in a loop (which
could be caught during parsing) works better as a check error, looking
at the error message the user will get. This might be wrong, haven't
thought too carefully about it yet).


TODO: canonicalize ast process, as part of type checking produces a
canonicalized ast which:
all implicit casts appear explicitly in the ast (maybe distinguished
from explicit casts?)
all names fully qualified
all types use canonical names
literal values and selectors in one form (use row style?)
nodes are tagged with types
what else?

Canonical form only defined for type consistent asts.

This canonical form should pretty print and parse back to the same
form, and type check correctly.
